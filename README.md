# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Human Face Generation

## Overview

This project focuses on generating realistic human faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are deep learning models composed of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other to generate highly realistic synthetic data. In this project, we train GAN models on a dataset of human faces to create new, believable face images.

## Dataset

- The project uses the CelebA dataset, which contains over 200,000 celebrity images.
- Each image is cropped and aligned to focus on the face, ensuring consistency and quality across the dataset.
- Images are preprocessed to a standard size and format suitable for input to the GAN models.

## Model Architecture

- **Generator**: The generator network learns to create new images that resemble the training data. It typically consists of convolutional layers followed by upsampling layers to generate high-resolution images.
- **Discriminator**: The discriminator network distinguishes between real images from the dataset and fake images generated by the generator. It uses convolutional layers to process image data and outputs a probability score indicating the authenticity of the input image.

## Training Process

- **Training Setup**: GANs are trained using adversarial training, where the generator and discriminator networks are optimized iteratively.
- **Loss Function**: The training process involves minimizing the binary cross-entropy loss between the predicted and actual labels for both the generator and discriminator.
- **Hyperparameters**: Adjustable parameters include learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of training epochs to achieve optimal performance.

## Evaluation and Results

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which measure the quality and diversity of generated images compared to real images.
- **Visualization**: Generated images are visualized periodically during training to observe improvements and convergence of the GAN models.

## Implementation Details

- **Frameworks**: The project is implemented using Python and deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Code Structure**: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, model architecture definitions (generator and discriminator), training loops, and evaluation scripts.
- **Dependencies**: Requirements.txt or environment.yml file specifies necessary packages and their versions for reproducibility.


## Updates

This is just the beginning of this project. As time goes on, I plan to update with more advanced models and techniques aimed at improving the quality and diversity of generated faces. Potential updates include:

- Implementing state-of-the-art GAN architectures such as StyleGAN and its variants.
- Incorporating self-supervised learning techniques to enhance the realism of generated faces.
- Exploring conditional GANs for generating faces with specific attributes or expressions.
- Experimenting with novel loss functions and regularization techniques to stabilize training and improve image quality.

Stay tuned for these updates as the project progresses!
